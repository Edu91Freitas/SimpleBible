<blockquote><h3>An Android Bible Offline application with easy navigation.</h3></blockquote>
This is a work in progress and so is being released as <strong>PUBLIC BETA</strong> via the play store.</br>
The patch versions of the app will be incremented till we reach a Feature Full status and when the application appears reday, the major version release will change.
Till then I hope to fill in all the gaps in patch releases.

I plan to work on the application each day if time permits, however it is proving difficult with a day job and other things considered.
However I will not abandon this project.
